# House Price Prediction (Regression Model)

This project leverages a Random Forest Regression model to predict house prices based on various housing attributes. The dataset contains features such as bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and more. This project demonstrates the end-to-end machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Introduction
The objective of this project is to predict the house prices using a dataset of housing attributes. The **Random Forest Regression** model is employed due to its robustness and suitability for handling complex, non-linear relationships within the data.

## Data Loading and Libraries
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `numpy`, `pandas`: For data manipulation and processing.
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: For data visualization.
  - `scikit-learn`: For model training, preprocessing, and evaluation.

- **Data Loading**:
  - The dataset (`kc_house_data.csv`) was loaded using `pandas.read_csv()` and contains 21,613 entries and 21 columns.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis was performed to understand the characteristics and relationships within the dataset.

1. **Data Summary**:
   - Initial data exploration (`dataset.info()` and `dataset.describe()`) confirmed the absence of missing values and gave insight into feature ranges.

2. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - A heatmap was created to visualize correlations between variables, helping identify relationships that might be useful in the model.

3. **Scatter Plots**:
   - Pairwise scatter plots were generated for key variables to observe potential patterns or relationships that could impact house prices.

## Data Preprocessing
1. **Dropping Unnecessary Columns**:
   - The `date` column was removed as it is not expected to contribute meaningfully to the prediction of house prices.

2. **Defining Features and Target**:
   - **Features (`X`)**: All columns except `price`.
   - **Target (`y`)**: `price` column.

3. **Train-Test Split**:
   - The data was split into training and test sets using an 80-20 split (`train_test_split()`), ensuring that the model is trained and evaluated on separate data.

## Feature Scaling
To ensure consistency and improve model performance, feature scaling was applied using `StandardScaler`.

- Both `X` (features) and `y` (target) were scaled to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, aiding in faster convergence during model training.

## Model Training and Testing
1. **Choosing the Model**:
   - **Random Forest Regressor** was selected due to its accuracy and ability to handle large datasets with complex features.
   - The model was configured with 100 estimators and a random state of 42 to ensure reproducibility.

2. **Training**:
   - The model was trained on the training set using `RandomForestRegressor.fit()`.

3. **Testing**:
   - Predictions were generated on the test set using `predict()`.

## Model Evaluation
- The **R² score** was chosen as the evaluation metric, providing insight into how well the model predicts variance in house prices.
- Achieved an **R² score of approximately 0.854**, indicating a strong fit and reliable predictive capability.

## Conclusion
The **House Price Prediction** project successfully demonstrates a comprehensive approach to building and evaluating a regression model using Random Forest. The model achieves a high level of accuracy and can be further improved through techniques like feature engineering or hyperparameter tuning.
