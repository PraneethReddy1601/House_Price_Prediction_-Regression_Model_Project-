## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to predict house prices based on a variety of real estate attributes. The **Random Forest Regression** model was chosen for its robustness and ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships in the data.

## Dataset
- **Source**: The dataset (`kc_house_data.csv`) contains 21,613 rows and 21 columns with features such as bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and price.
- **Target Variable**: `price` (the selling price of each house).
- **Feature Variables**: Attributes including `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `sqft_living`, `sqft_lot`, and more.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

To install the required libraries, run:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following key sections:
1. **Data Loading**: Reading and exploring the data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, transforming, and scaling the data.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizing and understanding relationships in the dataset.
4. **Modeling and Prediction**: Building and training the model, followed by making predictions.
5. **Evaluation and Results**: Assessing model performance using metrics like R² score.

## Data Preprocessing
1. **Dropping Unnecessary Columns**: The `date` column was dropped as it does not directly impact price prediction.
2. **Defining Features and Target**:
   - **Features (`X`)**: All columns except `price`.
   - **Target (`y`)**: The `price` column.
3. **Handling Missing Values**: No missing values were detected in the dataset.
4. **Train-Test Split**: The dataset was split into training and testing sets (80-20 split).
5. **Feature Scaling**: Standardization was applied using `StandardScaler` to normalize both `X` (features) and `y` (target), aiding in improved model convergence.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. **Data Summary**:
   - `dataset.info()` and `dataset.describe()` provided initial insights into data types and summary statistics.
2. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - A heatmap visualized correlations between features, identifying relationships that could influence house prices.
3. **Pairwise Scatter Plots**:
   - Scatter plots of key features revealed patterns and potential outliers in the data.

## Modeling and Prediction
1. **Model Selection**:
   - **Random Forest Regressor** was chosen for its flexibility and ability to handle complex datasets.
   - Parameters: 100 estimators, random state set to 42 for reproducibility.
2. **Training the Model**:
   - The model was trained on the training set using `fit()`.
3. **Prediction**:
   - Predictions were generated on the test set using `predict()`.

## Results
- The **R² score** was used to evaluate the model, indicating how well it captures the variance in house prices.
- The model achieved an **R² score of approximately 0.854**, reflecting a strong fit and reliable predictive accuracy.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the application of a Random Forest Regression model for predicting house prices. The model’s high R² score shows it can effectively capture relationships in the data, making it a reliable tool for price estimation in the real estate market.

## Future Improvements
1. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Adding new features such as the age of the house, proximity to amenities, or location-based metrics could improve predictive accuracy.
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Techniques like Grid Search or Random Search could optimize the Random Forest parameters for enhanced model performance.
3. **Model Comparison**:
   - Testing other algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, or Support Vector Regression) may yield further insights into the most suitable model for this dataset.
4. **Handling Outliers**:
   - Identifying and addressing outliers in the dataset could reduce noise and improve the model’s reliability.
5. **Incorporating Time-Dependent Features**:
   - Exploring the inclusion of time-based variables, if relevant, could capture seasonal or market trends affecting house prices.
